    <para>
        The primary goal of Apache Bigtop is to build a community around the packaging and interoperability testing of
        Hadoop-related projects. This includes testing at various levels (packaging, platform, runtime, upgrade,
        etc...)
        developed by a community with a focus on the system as a whole, rather than individual projects.

            This guide will be useful if you want to deploy your own cluster whether it is on virtual machines
            in a
            cloud or on real hardware in a datacenter or bedroom.

            No specific knowledge will be assumed and every topic will be introduced.
            However be mindful that distributed
            systems, and in particular

            frustration. The goal
            of this user guide is to prevent frustrations and to keep that experience rewarding.
